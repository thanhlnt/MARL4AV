# Multi-agent reinforcement learning for autonomous driving
 
 The testbed is built on top of the NetLogo platform, version 6.4.0, and use Python extension to implement RL algorithms.
 It is useful for researchers to study the traffic congestion reduction problem on highways or in urban areas. It can be used to test new RL algorithms.

 The 3D View interface of the testbed, for highways, is shown in following picture.

**Features:** <br />
The testbed has current following features:
- Scenario: _Two-way expressways_. Other scenarios are planned for future development.
- Driving-policy: _Greedy, Q-Learning, Double Q-Learning, SARSA, Deep Q-Network, Double Deep Q-Network_. Other driving-policies are planned for future development or under review.
