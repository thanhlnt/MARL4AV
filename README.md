# Multi-agent reinforcement learning model for autonomous driving
 
 The testbed is built on the NetLogo platform, version 6.4.0, and uses Python extension to implement RL algorithms.
 It is useful for researchers to study the traffic congestion reduction problem on highways or in urban areas. It can be used to test new RL algorithms.

 The 3D View of the testbed, for highways, is shown in the following picture.

**Features:** <br />
The testbed has current following features:
- Scenario: _Two-way expressways_. Other scenarios (urban, intersection, roundabout, ramp, ...) are planned for future development.
- Driving policy: _Greedy, Q-Learning, Double Q-Learning, SARSA, Deep Q-Network, Double Deep Q-Network_. Other RL driving policies are planned for future development or under review.

The testbed has been tested with the following configuration, especially for Deep RL algorithms <br />
